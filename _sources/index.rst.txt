Welcome to MDESops's documentation!
===================================

This package provides a convenient way of handling Discrete Event System models as
finite state automata. Additionally, some useful functions and operations on automata have been
implemented, including parallel/product compositions and observer computation. The goal is to provide a simple way to combine these operations in a modular environment, with the usability of Python which makes extending the functionalities provided here very straightforward.
